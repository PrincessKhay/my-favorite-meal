          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Lightly butter one 9-inch
            cake rounds. Dust with flour or cocoa powder and tap out the excess.
            Alternatively, you can lightly grease the pans and line with
            parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, mix together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking
            soda, baking powder, and salt in a stand mixer using a low speed
            until combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take a glass bowl and mix butter and sugar into it. Beat these
            ingredients till light and fluffy. Make sure that the sugar has
            dissolved. Now, beat in the eggs, two at a time and allowing at
            least two minutes gap between each addition. Lightly fold in the
            flour into the mixture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the batter into the prepared tin. Tap the cake pans gently on
            the counter to allow any bubbles to rise to the top and escape.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for 30-35 minutes in a 350 degree oven until a toothpick
            inserted into the center comes out clean.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cool on wire racks for 15 minutes and then remove the cakes from the
            pan and place on the wire rack to cool completely. Cover with your
            favourite toppings. Then slice and serve.
