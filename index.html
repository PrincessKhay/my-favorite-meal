      <h1>Pounded Yam & Egusi Soup</h1>
      <p class="first_p"><em> (My favorite meal)</em></p>
      <h2>ABOUT (origin)</h2>
      <p class="second_p">
        Pounded yam is a traditional Nigerian dish made from boiled yams that
        are mashed into a smooth, sticky paste. Pounding the yams breaks down
        the complex carbohydrates into simple sugars, which makes pounded yam
        easier to digest than boiled yams. Pounded yam is also a good source of
        dietary fiber, which is important for digestive health. Pounded yam is
        typically served with a stew or sauce, or even soup like egusi soup, and
        can be eaten as a main course or side dish. <br />
        Pounded yam or Iy√°n(Yoruba) is a Nigerian food native to the Yoruba,
        Igbo, Ebira and Tiv ethnic groups. It is a traditional food. It is
        prepared by pounding boiled yam with a mortar and pestle. Pounded yam is
        similar to mashed potatoes but heavier. It is a smooth and tasty
        delicacy traditionally eaten with the hands. <br />
        It is popularly eaten with egusi soup, a tasty stew made from ground
        melon seeds, tomatoes, onion and red palm oil. <br />
        The type of yam used for pounding yam is the African yam which is common
        in Africa and some parts of Asia. It is also known as puna yam, true yam
        or white yam. The texture is rough with brown skin and off-white flesh;
        its length ranges from that of regular potatoes up to five feet long.
        <br />
        Be it any occasion, <u>pounded yam and egusi soup never fails!</u> It
        creates memories through its taste and flavours.
